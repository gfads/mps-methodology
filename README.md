# MPS-Methodology

I apologize for any inconveniences, the code is being updated to better serve the readers of the paper.
 
MPS Methodology is a project that proposes applying the Multiple Preditors System (MPS) to forecasts time series extracted from Microservice-Based Applications (MBAs). In literature, works have applied time series forecasting to predict performance degradation in MBAs. However, all these studies use a single forecast model, which increases the risk of inaccurate estimates, which can lead the application to undesirable scenarios such as unavailability. MPS emerges as an alternative to this problem since it uses multiple models in the forecast. MPS basic idea of the ensemble is to combine the strengths of different learning algorithms to build a more accurate and reliable forecasting system.

More reliable and accurate forecasting systems are essential in proactive microservice auto-scaling systems. They improve the decision-making process of these systems by more reliably estimating microservices trends while mitigating incorrect adaptations triggered by inaccurate estimates. Consequently, microservices have a reduction in operating costs, and their customer satisfaction is maintained.

# Instalattion  

## How to install the software? 
 
    $ virtualenv venv
    $ source venv/bin/activate
    $ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    
## How to regenerate paper results using saved models?

### Download and extract from the models

Download the models from [OneDrive](https://cinufpe-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/wrms_cin_ufpe_br/EdLbxkskqx9Mo-dmWP3mgnABW6P3xL9_ItFgDbRprpFzeQ?e=yU35np) and save them inside the MPS Methodology folder. Models were uploaded externally due to their size.
  
    $ unzip models.zip
    
### Regenerate all results

Be patient. This process can take a while. Between 15-30 minutes per performance metric.

    $ rm Results/ -r; mkdir Results/
    $ python3 generate_mps_results.py 

If you wish, you can generate the values of a specific metric by changing the file [generate_mps_results.py in line 8](https://github.com/ML-Adapt/mps-methodology/blob/581c27a4e7e1e1e03b416f52fdd65b3abeabe563/generate_mps_results.py#L8).
For example, to generate results for just the memory metric, do:

    $ for metric in ['memory']:

# What do the folders generated by the results mean?

All processor results were stored in the Results folder. The description of each folder and its respective content is given below:
